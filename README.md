# Trees-Balancing-and-Rectangles

This repo is an exploration of self balancing search trees and code for solving the parallelpiped shadow problem. See http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/open/klee.html.

Goal 1 - Write fast code for the parallelpiped shadow problem, espcially in d=2.

Goal 2 - Write simplest possible code for self balancing trees, as a reference and practice for competition programming problems.
